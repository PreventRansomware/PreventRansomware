URL filtering/rewriting and DNS filtering combats credential phishing by preventing a user from loading a malicious page, even if they do click a bad link. This is often achieved with threat intelligence or page structure scanning. Administrators should filter out known phishing pages alongside newly observed/registered domains. Most DNS, URL and eMail filtration software will offer this protection as standard and you should ask your sales rep how to impliment it.
