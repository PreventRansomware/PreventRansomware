These appliances straddle the gap between the internet and the internal network, their somewhat precarious location (known as the DMZ or just edge) makes them an attractive target for attackers because successful compromise could create a pathway from the attacker\u2019s computer directly into the victim\u2019s internal network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Initial Compromise/Permissive Firewall Rules":{"id":"Initial Compromise/Permissive Firewall Rules","title":"Permissive Firewall Rules","description":"Firewalls filter traffic that travels in and out of a network. In an ideal world your firewall should allow nothing in and only the bare minimum out. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t how the real world works. System administrators need to open ports for various business reasons; attackers know this and scour the internet for open ports with which they can breach a network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Initial Compromise/Phishing Attacks":{"id":"Initial Compromise/Phishing Attacks","title":"Phishing Attacks","description":"Phishing attacks come in many flavours. Almost all of them are enjoyed by ransomware operators. Phishing is one of the most common ways for ransomware to seep into a network directly or indirectly. As an attack technique, its popularity is probably fuelled by its success which relies on social engineering.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Initial Compromise/Stolen Credentials":{"id":"Initial Compromise/Stolen Credentials","title":"Stolen Credentials","description":"It\'s common for ransomware gangs to break into organisations simply by logging into a network with stolen, guessed or purchased credentials. Yes, that\'s right, hackers are just logging in to your network to deploy ransomware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Initial Compromise/Summary":{"id":"Initial Compromise/Summary","title":"Summary","description":"As established in the introduction, attackers want to use the path of least resistance to compromise your network. This usually means exploiting the same handful of tried and true tactics which rely on misconfigurations and bad security practices. Believe it or not, these common misconfigurations are not hard to repair.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Ransomware is chalked up to be a complex threat to modern enterprises. Attackers infiltrate and cripple computer networks across the spectrum indiscriminately; hospitals, schools, factories, councils, utilities and of course government to name just a few.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Lists/Bad eMail File Extensions":{"id":"Lists/Bad eMail File Extensions","title":"Bad eMail File Extensions","description":"In an ideal world the following file extensions should not be allowed through your eMail gateway. This list isn\u2019t universal and may not be suitable for every organisation but instead should work as a guideline. You may find your business actually needs a particular file extension for their business, thats fine.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Post Compromise/Foreword":{"id":"Post Compromise/Foreword","title":"Foreword","description":"Once a ransomware operator has gotten onto your network, they want to achieve predictable objectives. In most cases, the attacker seeks:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Post Compromise/persistance":{"id":"Post Compromise/persistance","title":"Persistence","description":"Remote access tools like CobaltStrike Beacons avoid detection by living in RAM and never writing themselves into persistent storage; therefore, a system reboot might be enough to shake a successful beacon/implant. Attackers need their access to be persistent, so they can come back to the victim network and continue their operations day after day, or in some cases, for the few short hours it takes them to deploy ransomware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Post Compromise/Privilege Escalation":{"id":"Post Compromise/Privilege Escalation","title":"Privilege Escalation and Credential Theft","description":"When an attacker first gains their initial foothold on a network, they will most likely find themselves executing code as a low privileged user, perhaps an account used for general office work that has been phished with a malicious Excel document disguised as a business invoice.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Vendor Specific/introduction":{"id":"Vendor Specific/introduction","title":"Which EDR?","description":"PreventRansomware is an impartial and unsponsored source of cyber security education, but our guidance sometimes advocates buying cyber security tooling to solve security problems. Most of our advice can be implemented for free or cheaply, but as it stands, EDR isn\u2019t one of them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
