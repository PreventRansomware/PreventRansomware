# Introduction.
Ransomware is chalked up to be a complex threat to modern enterprises. So-called _sophisticated attackers_ infiltrate and cripple networks indiscriminately. These attacks are often quickly followed by a scary blog post from big-name security vendors who explain why this particular ransomware event was more sinister dangerous than the last. 

**However** ransomware operators run a low budget operation and just like every other working person in the world want the most reward and the biggest payout for the least amount of work necessary. 
This means most ransomware gangs aren't sophisticated at all. They want to take the path of least resistance and therefore enjoy simply logging into a target network via an unsecured VPN or an open RDP port. 

**PreventRansomware** intends to provide system administrators with free, no thrills, understandable advice for preventing these types of attacks with the technology they most likely already own. This website will not encourage you to buy new technology or licenses because they won't help you. Getting the basics right will. 

Follow this documentation through to the end, your network **will categorically be able to fend off the majority of today's ransomware attacks**.
