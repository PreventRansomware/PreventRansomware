These appliances straddle the gap between the internet and the internal network. This rather precarious location makes them an attractive target for attackers because successful compromise will most likely lead directly to the soft squishy center of a private network.",

Unfortunately having pesky firewalls on the perimeter means key ports are often blocked, key ports like RDP. (TCP 3389) RDP is used for remote system administration and user access which has increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thanks to this increase and plain bad system administration, many networks have exposed RDP directly to the open internet. At the time of writing there are over three million RDP ports open as per Shodan.",
