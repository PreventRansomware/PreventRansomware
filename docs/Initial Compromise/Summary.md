As established in the introduction, attackers want to use the path of least resistance to compromise your network. This usually means exploiting the same handful of tried and true tactics which rely on common misconfigurations and bad security practices.
Some of the most popular are:


- Exploiting an unpatched edge network appliance to gain remote code execution or stealing information such as usernames and passwords.
- Using stolen credentials to log directly into a network via a VPN or cloud service like AzureAD or Google Workspace.
- Many different types of phishing which could lead to having credentails stolen or malicious code being executed on the vicitim computer. 
- Brute forcing or guessing username and password combinations to gain access to a cloud or onpremise system.
 

In this section we will discuss how each of these attack methods work which in turn should help you understand how to prevent and detect them.
