# Introduction
Ransomware is chalked up to be a complex threat to modern enterprises. So-called _sophisticated attackers_ infiltrate and cripple networks indiscriminately. These attacks are often followed by blog posts from big brand security vendors who explain why this particular ransomware event was more sinister and advanced than the last.

**However**, just like every other working person in the world ransomware gangs want the most reward for the least amount of work necessary. 
This means most ransomware gangs aren't using sophisticated attack methods at all, they want to take the path of least resistance i.e exploiting common and easily fixed misconfigurations.

You donâ€™t need to buy expensive security software or hardware to prevent ransomware. Getting the he basics right will do.  

If you follow this documentation step by step to the end, your network **will be able to fend off the majority of today's ransomware attacks** and you most likely won't have to spend any money.
