# Introduction
Ransomware is chalked up to be a complex threat to modern enterprises. So-called _sophisticated attackers_ infiltrate and cripple networks indiscriminately. These attacks are often quickly followed by a scary blog post from big-name security vendors who explain why this particular ransomware event was more sinister and advanced than the last.

**However**, just like every other working person in the world ransomware gangs want the most reward and the biggest payout for the least amount of work necessary. 
This means most ransomware gangs aren't using sophisticated attack methods at all, they want to take the path of least resistance i.e exploiting common and easily fixed misconfigurations.

**PreventRansomware.io** intends to provide system administrators with free, no thrills, understandable advice for preventing these types of attacks with the technology they most likely already own. This website will not encourage you to buy licenses for cyber security tools because they won't help you. Getting the basics right will. 

If you follow this documentation step by step to the end, your network **will be able to fend off the majority of today's ransomware attacks** and you most likely won't have to spend a penny.
