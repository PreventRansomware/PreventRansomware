# Persistence

The first point of entry for attackers is known as “the initial foothold” This term encompasses credentials or a computer system that hackers have managed to gain some form of control over. Once an attacker has this control they need to ensure they can keep hold of it and come back to it at a later time, this is known as persistence. 

Persistence tactics in ransomware attacks are fairly consistent, well understood and documented which means defenders have a good chance of detecting them. There are  of course an incalculable number of persistence mechanisms in the broad technology stacks of modern businesses so here we will focus on the popular flavours that we have seen in ransomware reports.
