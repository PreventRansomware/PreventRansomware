As established in the introduction, attackers want to use the path of least resistance to compromise your network. This usually means taking advantage of the same handful of tried and true tactics which rely on common misconfigurations and bad security pratices.
Some of the most popular are:


- Exploiting an unpatched edge network appliance to gain remote code execution.
- Logging in directly to an edge network appliance using stolen or purchased legitimate credentials. 
- Logging in directly to machines that are exposed to the internet, for example, remote desktop. 
- Gaining remote code execution via phishing emails to users. 

In this section we will discuss how each of these attack methods work which in turn should help you understand how to prevent and detect them.
