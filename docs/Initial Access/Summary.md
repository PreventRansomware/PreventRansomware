As established in the introduction, attackers want to use the path of least resistance to compromise your network. This usually means exploiting the same handful of tried and true tactics which rely on common misconfigurations and bad security practices.
Some of the most popular are:


- Exploiting an unpatched edge network appliance to gain remote code execution or stealing information such as usernames and passwords.
- Logging in directly to an edge network appliance using stolen (phishing) or purchased legitimate credentials. 
- Logging in directly to machines that are exposed to the internet, for example via remote desktop. 
- Gaining remote code execution via phishing emails to users.
 

In this section we will discuss how each of these attack methods work which in turn should help you understand how to prevent and detect them.
