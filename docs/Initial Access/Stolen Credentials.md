Consumers of security tools are led to believe that Ransomware is a complex threat, but in the real world this could not be further from the truth. 
It's common for ransomware gangs to break into organisations simply by logging into a network with stolen, guessed or purchased credentials. Yes, that's right, hackers are just literally just logging in. 


### Updating your approach to passwords.

Traditional password policies such as: 
_Eight characters, one special character, one uppercase character and forced expiry_ leads users into bad password habits which result in weak passwords like the following:

- Summer19?
- Summer21!
- Football96!

These passwords are easy for attackers to guess, brute force or crack from stolen password hashes. You should help staff by setting a more modern password policy with length and longevity in mind, which means long and rarely expiring passwords. As per advice from NIST and Microsoft you should consider modernising your approach to passwords:

- Maintain an 8-character or more minimum length requirement. Ransomware.io recommends 16-charecters.Â 
- Don't require character composition requirements. For example, *&(^%$ or a particular number of uppercase or lowercase letters.
- Don't require mandatory periodic password resets for user accounts aka password expiry. Ransomware.io recommends a once yearly password rotation.
- Ban common passwords, to keep the most vulnerable passwords out of your system.
- Enforce 2FA for all users.

Thanks to its lack of expiry and long, non-complex requirements, this policy encourages strong passphrases like song lyrics or passages from books, such as:

- Welcome to the jungle
- Hello my old friend
- Cheetos are the only way!
